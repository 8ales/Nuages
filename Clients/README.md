## Nuages Clients

Nuages is available through REST or socket.io and as such, clients can be implemented in any form. 

The following clients are currently available:

 * The Nuages_Cli client is the default client to access Nuages, it is a available over command line.

 * The Nuages_WebCli client is a browser version of the Nuages_Cli client.
 
 Both these clients were originally developped for development and testing purposes but they are reliable despite the spaghetti code.
